Infopark-Politics
=================

Infopark-Politics was derived from mperham-politics. All parts except of the StaticQueueWorker had
eventually been dropped. The StaticQueueWorker remained for breaking up work into a large amount of
pieces (called buckets) which then are distributed on n worker nodes where n ist the total number
of nodes.

Actually there is no further documentation availableâ€¦
